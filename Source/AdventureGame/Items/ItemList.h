     *
     * Items are always added at the end. This is a little
     * expensive as we don't keep a tail pointer or backlinks. But its
     * still very fast even for dozens of items.
     *
     * One issue is that the TList::ElementType is a plain pointer
     * to UInventoryItem which is not recognised by the UE GC. To
     * make sure the item is retained, register it via
